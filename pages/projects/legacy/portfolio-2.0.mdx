# Portfolio Site v2.0

<Hero src="/Portfolio-2.0.png" alt="screenshot of my second portfolio site" repo="https://github.com/LadyBluenotes/portfolio-2.0" />

With the first rendition of my site, I had used a template to personalize from there. This site I was motivated to build it from scratch while using Next.js to help with routing and learn more about the framework.

## I. Getting started

### Prerequisites

In addition to an internet browser and IDE, he following must be installed on your machine:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Installation

How to install and run the application.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/LadyBluenotes/portfolio-2.0/
```

3. Install Node packages
```bash copy
npm install
```

3. Start the application
```bash copy
npm run dev
```

## II. About

### Built with
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

I developed this project using Next.js and used CSS for styling purposes. My main objective was to use it as a learning tool to gain a better understanding of Next.js and how it differed from React.

One aspect I particularly aimed to explore was the routing in Next.js. Additionally, I wanted to delve into their approach to handling styles. To keep my learning focused, I intentionally kept the project simple by using basic CSS for styling. I did include one additional library for incorporating motion effects, but by maintaining this simplicity, I aimed to enhance my understanding of Next.js without unnecessary complexities.

## III. Motivation

During my journey of learning React, I frequently came across Next.js as a highly-discussed framework. As I embarked on this project, I was aware that Next.js provided routing capabilities, eliminating the need for an additional library like React Router in traditional React applications. I also knew that Next.js was built upon React, and I was eager to explore its similarities and differences.

To maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary complexities, I decided to keep this project focused on Next.js and CSS. Once I had established the foundational elements of the website, I wanted to include some dynamic motion effects. Because of this, I used the Framer Motion library into the project.

By keeping to a straightforward approach, I fostered a deeper understanding of Next.js while preserving a clear learning trajectory.

## IV. Key takeaways

### Discoveries and reflections

Upon first glance, I always assumed that writing documentation was fairly straighforward but upon closer examination, it becomes evident that it encompases various crucial components. One fundamental aspect to consider when embarking on the documentation journey was figuring out *what to write*. Things I had to consider when writing this included:
1. **Organizing and structuring information:** I needed to consider how to organize and structure the information effectively. This involved creating clear sections and headings for different topics, projects, and contributions. I also had to ensure logical flow within each section, arranging the content in a way that is easy for readers to follow and understand.
2. **Visual elements:** To enhance the readability and comprehension of my documentation, I incorporated visual elements. This included using screenshots, images, or code snippets to illustrate the style of the site, or steps in each project.

### Technical growth

#### Next Routing

I chose Next.js because of its built-in routing system, which made navigation within my application a breeze. I no longer needed to rely on external libraries like React Router to handle routing. Next.js allowed me to define routes simply by adding files to the pages directory. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Next.js supports nested routes. By creating a folder with an `index.js` file inside the pages directory, I was able to easily create a nested route. This feature opened up new possibilities for creating more complex routing structures in my projects in the future.

#### Styling with Next

Unlike traditional React applications where CSS is typically linked globally, Next.js supports built-in CSS files. These are imported directly into individual components, allowing me to style each component separately. This approach, known as scoped styling, kept my styles contained within the respective components, leading to better modularity and separation of concerns. By embracing this method, I found it easier to manage and maintain my styles while avoiding conflicts with global CSS.

#### The Capabilities with Next.js

Next powerful capabilities that simplify various aspects of web development. One is the built-in `Image` component, which automatically optimizes imported images by handling resizing, lazy loading, and serving the appropriate format based on browser support. This feature not only significantly improved application performance but also simplified image management. Another is that it provides a `Head` component, showcasing easy additions of meta tags to pages. This allows optimization of applications for search engines, enhanced visibility, and provide relevant information for sharing.

## V. Acknowledgements

Throughout the development of this project, I used the Next.js documentation to grasp the framework's concepts and implementation. To incorporate motion effects, I referred to the Framer Motion documentation, which provided valuable insights into leveraging the library effectively. Additionally, for the background animation, I took inspiration from another developer's work, adapting it to create a unique animation for my project (will update with link if/when I find the source).

## VI. Additional Information

As this site is no longer my portfolio site, I have discontinued monitoring issues and features related to it. Furthermore, since it is no longer deployed to a domain, there is no accessible location to view it.
