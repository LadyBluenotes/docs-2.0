# Portfolio Site v1.0

<Hero src="/Portfolio-1.0.png" alt="screenshot of my first portfolio site" repo="https://github.com/LadyBluenotes/Portfolio" />

In the early stages of my web development journey, I opted to use a template for my portfolio site. This choice stemmed from my limited experience in the field. By using the template's design and structure, I was able to kickstart the creation of a professional-looking portfolio while focusing on customizing the content to be personal to myself.

## I. Getting started

## II. About

### Built with
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [HTML](https://html.com/)

During my early stages of learning web development, I chose a template as a starting point for my portfolio site. This template provided a foundation that I could build upon and customize to my preferences. As I gained proficiency, I gradually modified the HTML structure and adjusted the CSS styles to tailor the site. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply what I was learning in real-time and gain a deeper understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create visually appealing and functional websites.

## III. Motivation

Creating a portfolio served as a pivotal step in my professional journey, enabling me to track my growth and showcase my skills. With the aim of seeking future job opportunities, I utilized the portfolio as a tangible representation of my accomplishments and capabilities. By highlighting what I had learned up to this point, I was able to present an overview of my abilities and experience.

## IV. Key takeaways

The main reflections I had after working on this was how creating a visual representation of yourself as a developer is important. Through this site, it not only served the purpose of showcasing my skills and experiences but helped establish my personal brand, emphasizing the power of storytelling, encouraging collaboration and networking, and promoting continuous learning and growth. It is a powerful tool to make a lasting impact in the competitive world of development and open doors to exciting opportunities.

## VI. Additional Information

As this site is no longer my portfolio site, I have discontinued monitoring issues and features related to it. Furthermore, since it is no longer deployed to a domain, there is no accessible location to view it.
